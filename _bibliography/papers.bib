abstract = {The paper presents a comprehensive closed-form performance analysis framework for multihop communications over Weibull fading channels. This framework may be of interest in different applications in the contexts of beyond-5G (B5G) and Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. The analyzed scheme consists generally of multiple regenerative relays, and we also consider generalized high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) transmissions. To take into consideration the channel fading, we adopt the Weibull model for its largely flexible ability to cover different channel conditions in different application contexts. The end-to-end performance is evaluated in terms of outage probability, bit error probability (BER), symbol error probability (SER), block error rate (BLER), ergodic capacity, and energy efficiency (EE). For all the metrics, we present exact closed-form expressions—along with their asymptotic behavior—capitalizing on the powerful generalized hypergeometric functions. To illustrate the utility of the obtained analytical results, we derive two BER- and EE-optimal transmit power allocation strategies, and we discuss the resulting performance gains. The exactness of our analysis is illustrated by numerical examples, and assessed via Monte-Carlo simulations for different system and channel parameters. Finally, as a secondary contribution, and noting the increasing popularity of single and bivariate Fox’s H-function, we provide generalized Matlab codes for computing these functions which are of practical utility in many fields.}

abstract = {Abstract This study investigates power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access based wireless information exchange process. The investigation considers a dual-hop non-regenerative full-duplex wireless one-way relaying networks in the system model, where the source terminal transmits two different types of information and subtracts the interference signal at the destination by using successive interference cancellation technique. The outage probability, error probability, achievable rate, and ergodic rate of the considered system is analytically derived. In addition, optimum power allocation coefficients and relay terminal position are determined using the optimization techniques. Monte-Carlo simulation results validate the analytical and asymptotic derivations. The derived analytical expressions are found closely in agreement with the system level numerical results.},

ABSTRACT={Scalable and sustainable AI-driven analytics are necessary to enable large-scale and heterogeneous service deployment in sixth-generation (6G) ultra-dense networks. This implies that the exchange of raw monitoring data should be minimized across the network by bringing the analysis functions closer to the data collection points. While federated learning (FL) is an efficient tool to implement such a decentralized strategy, real networks are generally characterized by time- and space-varying traffic patterns and channel conditions, making thereby the data collected in different points non independent and identically distributed (non-IID), which is challenging for FL. To sidestep this issue, we first introduce a new a priori metric that we call dataset entropy, whose role is to capture the distribution, the quantity of information, the unbalanced structure and the “non-IIDness” of a dataset independently of the models. This a priori entropy is calculated using a multi-dimensional spectral clustering scheme over both the features and the supervised output spaces, and is suitable for classification as well as regression tasks. The FL aggregation operations support system (OSS) server then uses the reported dataset entropies to devise 1) an entropy-based federated averaging scheme, and 2) a stochastic participant selection policy to significantly stabilize the training, minimize the convergence time, and reduce the corresponding computation cost. Numerical results are provided to show the superiority of these novel approaches.}
