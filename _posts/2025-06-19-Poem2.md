# **Starflower**

*Dwelling memories insatiably drift*  
*Toward your idyllic imprint,*  
*As though a starflower joyfully blooms*  
*After your grace passed through.*  

*And all the promises that once*  
*Relentlessly called us,*  
*Used to be a mere fantasy*  
*In your wild heart.*  

*And your Sky is a haven for the reminiscent,*  
*And my Sky is a ceiling for the wandering shepherd.*  

*Between both Skies, a genealogy of two steps,*  
*And between the two instantsâ€”*  
*The complicity of two estrangements.*  

*And I am with you, yet not with you,*  
*Eternally in the gala of your distance.*
