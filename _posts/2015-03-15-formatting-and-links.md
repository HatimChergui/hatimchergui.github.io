# **Letter to Sheila**

*A prayer from the Daughter of Heights, Sheila,  
To the keeper of secret dawn:*  
*Bloom for me in my boundless Haven,  
A wild Language,  
Worthy of  
A Rosetta Stone,*  
*And Melissa's heart longs  
For the lisp of its letters:  
In Sheila's eyes, a hidden yearning,  
Secrets passing to you,  
Wall carvings  
Etched by wonder for your view,*  
*And In her evening song,  
Babylon revived,  
If only you knew the path  
To her wounded sighs.*
