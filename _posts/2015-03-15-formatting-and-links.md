**Letter to Sheila**

*Daughter of heights, O Sheila,  
A prayer to the keeper of secrets and grace,  
To bloom for me in my distant place,  
A wild language,  
Without its home,  
A Rosetta Stone,* 

*And Melissa's heart longs  
For the lisp of its letters,  
And the hearts of the returners,  
To match its threads,  
In Sheila's eyes, a hidden yearning,  
Secrets passing to you,  
Wall carvings  
etched by wonder for your view,* 

*In her evening song,  
Babylon revived,  
If only you knew the path  
to her wounded sighs.*
