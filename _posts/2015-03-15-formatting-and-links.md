**Letter to Sheila**

*A prayer from the Daughter of Heights, Sheila,
To the keeper of secret dawn:
Bloom for me in my boundless Haven,  
A wild Language,
Worthy of
A Rosetta Stone,* 
*And Melissa's heart longs  
For the lisp of its letters:  
In Sheila's eyes, a hidden yearning,  
Secrets passing to you,  
Wall carvings  
etched by wonder for your view,* 
*And In her evening song,  
Babylon revived,  
If only you knew the path  
to her wounded sighs.*
