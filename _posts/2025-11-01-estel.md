# **Letter to Estel**

*Dwelling memories insatiably drift*  
*Toward your idyllic imprint,*  
*As though a starflower joyfully blooms*  
*After your grace passed through,*  

*And all the promises that once*  
*Relentlessly called us*  
*Long stood as a celestial vision*  
*In your wild heart.*  

*And your Sky is a haven for the reminiscent,*  
*And my Sky is a ceiling for the wandering shepherd:*  

*Between the twin Skies a genealogy of two steps,*  
*And between the two instants*  
*The complicity of two estrangements.*  

*And I am with you, yet not with you,*  
*Eternally in the ceremony of your presence.*
