# **Sheila’s Heights**

*A prayer from the Daughter of Heights, Sheila,*
*To the keeper of mysterious dawn:*
*Bloom for me in my boundless haven,*
*A wild language,*
*Worthy of a Rosetta Stone,*
*And Melissa’s heart longs for the lisp*
*of its letters,*
*For in subtle lapsus,*
*Resides her own tone:*
*In Sheila’s eyes, a hidden yearning,*
*Secrets passing to you,*
*Mural carvings*
*Etched by wonder for your view,*
*And in her evening song,*
*A revived Babylon,*
*If only you knew the path*
*To her wounded sighs.*
