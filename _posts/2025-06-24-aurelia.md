# *Aurélia* (in memory of Nerval)

*Oh Aurélia, do you recall*  
*The dream whose morning is not yet born?*  
*Images captivated by the night,*  
*Longing and dew stirred your sleepless plight.*  
*For I am the one*  
*Who addresses — within you —*  
*The distance of your velvety existence,*  
*On the morning when tears*  
*Are healed by reunion’s light.*  

*And I call your noble name*  
*At the grand gate:*  

*From the lightning of your gaze,*  
*Great cities are born.*  
*The geranium asks its question*  
*Upon its thresholds,*  
*And the swallows of dusk*  
*Test its ramparts, weather-worn.*  

*So too do longings awaken*  
*Within its ancient dwellings,*  
*To shape you forever*  
*As a thought cradled by shadow, unshaken.*
