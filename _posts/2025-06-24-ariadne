# **Ariadne’s Thread**

*A message to the one whose life will be revived by a pen:*  
You are from me, and I from you—  
No matter how our images differ,  
In the forest of mirrors,  
a dream bears witness to us then.  
And peace be upon your luminous letters,  
resting among the leaves  
of Sufi basil,  
where your imagination is drawn  
by Ariadne’s thread  
toward the land  
where all wild thoughts bloom:  
Your morning  
is an inspired dewdrop dawn.
