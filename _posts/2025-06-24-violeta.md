# **Violeta's Ode**

*Beyond the door of dream lies a calling letter:*  
*I found, in the Sufi sea, my second river*  
*Where the memory of Ophelia floats*  
*Like a vision-boat*  
*Upon the undulations of your Ode,*  

*And the seagulls trace your violet name*  
*To guide the drifting wishes*  
*Toward your silhouette.*  

*Violeta: you are that dreamy prayer,*  
*And the fibers crossing oceans take turns*  
*Bringing the light of your soul*  
*Closer to the meeting points*  
*Consecrated by the World.*
